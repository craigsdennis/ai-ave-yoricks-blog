# Truth Window ðŸªŸ

**A transparent look into AI-human collaboration**

## What is this?

The `truth-window` directory is an educational experiment that documents the real, unfiltered development process of this project. It captures:

- **What the human asked for** (requirements, requests, changes)
- **What the AI actually did** (implementation details, decisions made)
- **The reasoning behind each decision** (why certain approaches were chosen)
- **Challenges and solutions** (problems encountered and how they were solved)

## Purpose

This directory serves as:

1. **Educational Resource** - Learn how AI-human collaboration works in real software development
2. **Transparency Window** - See the actual development process, not just the polished final result
3. **Decision Trail** - Understand why certain technical choices were made
4. **Learning Tool** - Study patterns of effective AI-human collaboration

## Structure

Each session is documented as a separate markdown file:

- `session-01-frontend.md` - Initial frontend implementation
- `session-02-categories.md` - Category system implementation
- `session-03-...` - Future sessions as they happen

## Format

Each session document includes:

- **Human Request** - What was asked for
- **AI Response** - What was implemented
- **Technical Decisions** - Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Challenges** - Problems encountered and solutions
- **Outcome** - Final result and any follow-up needed

## Why "Truth Window"?

In construction, a "truth window" is a small section left unfinished to show the actual building materials and construction methods hidden behind the finished walls. Similarly, this directory shows the actual development process behind the polished application.

## For Developers

If you're learning about:
- AI-assisted development
- Vue.js + TypeScript projects
- Cloudflare Workers/D1 development
- Human-AI collaboration patterns

These documents provide real examples of how development decisions are made and implemented in practice.
